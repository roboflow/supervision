# count people in zone

## üëã hello

This demo is a video analysis tool that counts and highlights objects in specific zones
of a video. Each zone and the objects within it are marked in different colors, making
it easy to see and count the objects in each area. The tool can save this enhanced
video or display it live on the screen.

## üíª install

- clone repository and navigate to example directory

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/roboflow/supervision.git
  cd supervision/examples/count_people_in_zone
  ```

- setup python environment and activate it [optional]

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- install required dependencies

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- download `traffic_analysis.pt` and `traffic_analysis.mov` files

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è script arguments

- ultralytics

  - `--source_weights_path` (optional): The path to the YOLO model's weights file.
    Defaults to `"yolov8x.pt"` if not specified.

  - `--zone_configuration_path`: Specifies the path to the JSON file containing zone
    configurations. This file defines the polygonal areas in the video where objects will
    be counted.
  - `--source_video_path`: The path to the source video file that will be analyzed.
  - `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with annotations.
    If not provided, the processed video will be displayed in real-time.
  - `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO model
    to filter detections. Default is `0.3`.
  - `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
    for the model. Default is `0.7`.

- inference

  - `--roboflow_api_key` (optional): The API key for Roboflow services. If not provided
    directly, the script tries to fetch it from the `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` environment
    variable. Follow [this guide](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key)
    to acquire your `API KEY`.
  - `--model_id` (optional): Designates the Roboflow model ID to be used. The default
    value is `"yolov8x-1280"`.

  - `--zone_configuration_path`: Specifies the path to the JSON file containing zone
    configurations. This file defines the polygonal areas in the video where objects will
    be counted.
  - `--source_video_path`: The path to the source video file that will be analyzed.
  - `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with annotations.
    If not provided, the processed video will be displayed in real-time.
  - `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO model
    to filter detections. Default is `0.3`.
  - `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
    for the model. Default is `0.7`.

## üìå zone configuration

- `horizontal-zone-config.json`: Defines zones divided horizontally across the frame.
- `multi-zone-config.json`: Configures multiple zones with custom shapes and positions.
- `quarters-zone-config.json`: Splits the frame into four equal quarters.
- `vertical-zone-config.json`: Divides the frame into vertical zones of equal width.

## ‚öôÔ∏è run example

- ultralytics

  ```bash
  python ultralytics_example.py \
  --zone_configuration_path data/multi-zone-config.json \
  --source_video_path data/market-square.mp4 \
  --confidence_threshold 0.3 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5
  ```

- inference

  ```bash
  python inference_example.py \
  --roboflow_api_key <ROBOFLOW API KEY> \
  --zone_configuration_path data/multi-zone-config.json \
  --source_video_path data/market-square.mp4 \
  --confidence_threshold 0.3 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5
  ```
