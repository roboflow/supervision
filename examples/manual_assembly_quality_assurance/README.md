# Manual Assembly Quality Assurance

[![Roboflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roboflow-ai/notebooks/main/assets/badges/roboflow-blogpost.svg)](https://blog.roboflow.com/manual-assembly-qa-computer-vision/)

## üëã hello

This example shows how to build a manual assembly quality assurance system with computer vision. The accompanying blog post walks through how to train a model to identify industrial parts.

The code in this project lets you run the model with Inference and process predictions with supervision's tracking and smoothing. Predictions are visualized with supervision and OpenCV.

## üíª install

- clone repository and navigate to example directory

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/roboflow/supervision.git
  cd supervision/examples/manual_assembly_quality_assurance
  ```

- setup python environment and activate it [optional]

  ```bash
  python3.10 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- install required dependencies

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- set Roboflow API key as environment variable

  ```bash
  export ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=<YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY>
  ```
  Follow [this guide](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key)
  to acquire your Roboflow API key.

## üõ†Ô∏è script arguments

- `--model_id`: Designates the Roboflow model ID to be used. [Learn how to retrieve your model ID](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/workspace-and-project-ids).

- `--order`: Required. The order in which the parts are assembled. This is used to
  ensure an assembler picks up pieces in the correct order. This should be a list of comma-separated strings. Each item in the list must be exactly equal to the class name associated with the object you want to identify. You can find your class names using the "Class Name" tab in the Roboflow model's "Classes" section.

- `--video`: Required. The path to the video file you want to process.

- `--classes`: Required. The classes that the model is trained to identify. This should be a list of comma-separated strings. Each item in the list must be exactly equal to the class name associated with the object you want to identify. You can find your class names using the "Class Name" tab in the Roboflow model's "Classes" section.

## ‚öôÔ∏è run

  ```bash
    python3 app.py \
      -o "Yellow 4x2 Brick, Blue 4x2 Brick, Green 4x2 Brick" \
      -v ./parts2.MOV \
      -m "lego-assembly/4" \
      -c "Blue 4x2 Brick, Green 4x2 Brick, Yellow 4x2 Brick"
  ```

  The script above would look for the order `Yellow 4x2 Brick, Blue 4x2 Brick, Green 4x2 Brick` in the video `./parts2.MOV` using the model with ID `lego-assembly/4`. The classes are `Blue 4x2 Brick, Green 4x2 Brick, Yellow 4x2 Brick`.
