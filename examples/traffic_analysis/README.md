# traffic analysis

## üëã hello

This script performs traffic flow analysis using YOLOv8, an object-detection method and
ByteTrack, a simple yet effective online multi-object tracking method. It uses the
supervision package for multiple tasks such as tracking, annotations, etc.

## üíª install

- clone repository and navigate to example directory

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/roboflow/supervision.git
  cd supervision/examples/traffic_analysis
  ```

- setup python environment and activate it [optional]

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- install required dependencies

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- download `traffic_analysis.pt` and `traffic_analysis.mov` files

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è script arguments

- ultralytics

  - `--source_weights_path`: Required. Specifies the path to the YOLO model's weights
    file, which is essential for the object detection process. This file contains the
    data that the model uses to identify objects in the video.

  - `--source_video_path`: Required. The path to the source video file that will be
    analyzed. This is the input video on which traffic flow analysis will be performed.
  - `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with
    annotations. If not specified, the processed video will be displayed in real-time
    without being saved.
  - `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO
    model to filter detections. Default is `0.3`. This determines how confident the
    model should be to recognize an object in the video.
  - `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
    for the model. Default is 0.7. This value is used to manage object detection
    accuracy, particularly in distinguishing between different objects.

- inference

  - `--roboflow_api_key` (optional): The API key for Roboflow services. If not provided
    directly, the script tries to fetch it from the `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` environment
    variable. Follow [this guide](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key)
    to acquire your `API KEY`.
  - `--model_id` (optional): Designates the Roboflow model ID to be used. The default
    value is `"vehicle-count-in-drone-video/6"`.

  - `--source_video_path`: Required. The path to the source video file that will be
    analyzed. This is the input video on which traffic flow analysis will be performed.
  - `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with
    annotations. If not specified, the processed video will be displayed in real-time
    without being saved.
  - `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO
    model to filter detections. Default is `0.3`. This determines how confident the
    model should be to recognize an object in the video.
  - `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
    for the model. Default is 0.7. This value is used to manage object detection
    accuracy, particularly in distinguishing between different objects.
