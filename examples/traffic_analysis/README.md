# traffic analysis

## üëã hello

This script performs traffic flow analysis using YOLOv8, an object-detection method and
ByteTrack, a simple yet effective online multi-object tracking method. It uses the
supervision package for multiple tasks such as tracking, annotations, etc.

## üíª install

- clone repository and navigate to example directory

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/roboflow/supervision.git
  cd supervision/examples/traffic_analysis
  ```

- setup python environment and activate it [optional]

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- install required dependencies

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- download `traffic_analysis.pt` and `traffic_analysis.mov` files

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è script arguments

### inference args

- `--roboflow_api_key`: Your [Roboflow API key](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key)
- `--model_id` (optional): Specifies the Roboflow model id (dataset/version) to use for inference. See [COCO models on Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/microsoft/coco/dataset/13). Default is `yolov8x-1280`.
- `--source_video_path`: Required. The path to the source video file that will be
  analyzed. This is the input video on which traffic flow analysis will be performed.
- `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with annotations.
  If not specified, the processed video will be displayed in real-time without being
  saved.
- `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO model
  to filter detections. Default is `0.3`. This determines how confident the model should
  be to recognize an object in the video.
- `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
  for the model. Default is 0.7. This value is used to manage object detection accuracy,
  particularly in distinguishing between different objects.

### ultralytics args

- `--source_weights_path`: Required. Specifies the path to the YOLO model's weights
  file, which is essential for the object detection process. This file contains the data
  that the model uses to identify objects in the video.
- `--source_video_path`: Required. The path to the source video file that will be
  analyzed. This is the input video on which traffic flow analysis will be performed.
- `--target_video_path` (optional): The path to save the output video with annotations.
  If not specified, the processed video will be displayed in real-time without being
  saved.
- `--confidence_threshold` (optional): Sets the confidence threshold for the YOLO model
  to filter detections. Default is `0.3`. This determines how confident the model should
  be to recognize an object in the video.
- `--iou_threshold` (optional): Specifies the IOU (Intersection Over Union) threshold
  for the model. Default is 0.7. This value is used to manage object detection accuracy,
  particularly in distinguishing between different objects.
