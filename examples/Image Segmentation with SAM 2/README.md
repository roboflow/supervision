# Grounded SAM2 - Image Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates text-driven image segmentation using Meta's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). The implementation focuses on converting various input prompts (points, boxes) into precise object segmentation masks.

## Features

- **Point-based Segmentation**: Select objects using positive/negative points
- **Bounding Box Prompts**: Use bounding boxes for object selection
- **Combined Prompts**: Mix points and boxes for precise control
- **Batched Processing**: Handle multiple prompts and images efficiently
- **Interactive Visualization**: Clear display of masks with confidence scores

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to this directory:
```bash
