class TrackState:
    """
    Enumeration type for the single target track state. Newly created tracks are
    classified as `tentative` until enough evidence has been collected. Then,
    the track state is changed to `confirmed`. Tracks that are no longer alive
    are classified as `deleted` to mark them for removal from the set of active
    tracks.

class Track:
    """
    A single target track with state space `(x, y, a, h)` and associated
    velocities, where `(x, y)` is the center of the bounding box, `a` is the
    aspect ratio and `h` is the height.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mean : ndarray
        Mean vector of the initial state distribution.
    covariance : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the initial state distribution.
    track_id : int
        A unique track identifier.
    n_init : int
        Number of consecutive detections before the track is confirmed. The
        track state is set to `Deleted` if a miss occurs within the first
        `n_init` frames.
    max_age : int
        The maximum number of consecutive misses before the track state is
        set to `Deleted`.
    feature : Optional[ndarray]
        Feature vector of the detection this track originates from. If not None,
        this feature is added to the `features` cache.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mean : ndarray
        Mean vector of the initial state distribution.
    covariance : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the initial state distribution.
    track_id : int
        A unique track identifier.
    hits : int
        Total number of measurement updates.
    age : int
        Total number of frames since first occurance.
    time_since_update : int
        Total number of frames since last measurement update.
    state : TrackState
        The current track state.
    features : List[ndarray]
        A cache of features. On each measurement update, the associated feature
        vector is added to this list.
